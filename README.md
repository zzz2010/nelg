# Never-Ending Genome Learning

It is distributed data mining system based JPPF for regulatory Genomics data, like ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data. 

My long-term goal is to build a “never-ending genome learning” machine. This machine can generate high-confidence knowledge automatically by analyzing the inter-correlation of the existing genomics data iteratively, and incrementally update the knowledge database when new data generated.
